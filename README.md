# EndlessRunnerFinalFinal

I tried making a very simple flappy bird like endless runner, but instead of the characters bouncing, you have complete control over them; and also there are projectiles.

I intended on doing the score system in C++ but for some reason Live Coding would not work for me, no matter how many solutions I would try and how many tutorials I would watch on how to fix it, and I was also unable to make any builds through my IDE, so sadly I couldn't implement it (this has been hell). Hopefully the code is still somewhere in the files to show my somewhat understanding of C++.
